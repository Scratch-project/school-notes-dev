# School Notes - Development

⚠️ **DEVELOPMENT REPOSITORY** - This is the experimental development version for testing new features.

A comprehensive collection of study materials for various school subjects, built with [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/).

## 🌐 Live Sites

- **Development Site (this repo)**: [https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/school-notes-dev](https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/school-notes-dev)
- **Production Site**: [https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/school-notes](https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/school-notes)

## 🚧 Development Purpose

This repository is used for:
- **Testing new features** before deploying to production
- **Experimenting with layouts** and design improvements
- **Validating content changes** in a safe environment
- **Trying new Quartz plugins** and configurations

## 📚 Available Subjects

### Physics ✅ (In Development)
- **Atomic Physics** - Nuclear physics, radiation types, and decay processes
- **Wave Mechanics** - Wave properties, interference, and polarization  
- **Electromagnetic Theory** - Electric and magnetic fields
- **Quantum Mechanics** - Quantum objects and uncertainty principles
- **Formula Collections** - Essential physics formulas and constants

### Planned Subjects
- **Mathematics** - Calculus, linear algebra, statistics
- **Chemistry** - Organic, inorganic, and physical chemistry
- **Biology** - Cell biology, genetics, ecology

## 🔄 Workflow

### Development Process
1. **Make changes** in this development repository
2. **Test thoroughly** using the development site
3. **Validate content** and features work correctly
4. **Merge stable changes** to the production repository

### Branch Strategy
- `main` - Stable development version
- `dev` - Experimental features and testing
- `feature/*` - Specific feature development

## 🚀 Deployment

This development site automatically builds and deploys to GitHub Pages on push to `main` or `dev` branches.

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone the development repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/school-notes-dev.git
cd school-notes-dev

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npx quartz build --serve
```
